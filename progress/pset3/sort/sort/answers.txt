sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It's worst case scenario is fives times larger than its worse case scenario

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It has an equal best and worse case scenario and its number of steps to
    operate over 50000 elements is significantly lower than sort3 which takes 2.5 * 10ˆ9 steps

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It has the same best and worse case scenario, however,
    when one does O(50000ˆ2) = ˜2.5 * 10ˆ9 steps is significantly greater in magnitude than
    O(50000log50000) = ˜234000 steps
